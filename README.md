### I have first been asked to create the variable and test whether the variable is true AND test if the variable adds up to the correct total

# rspec_matchers_intro
### I have been given an rspec file and asked to fix the errors to get the test working

# rspec_calulator
### I have created a test program to calculate with all calculating operations. All have passes. I have also included a hook so all new calculations do not need to be called all the time.

# ProjectEuler
### I have been asked to test a program that calculates the total numbers that are in the array. The problem only calculates when a number is divisible by 3 or 5. This is the fizzbizz problem.

###Â I have been given a task to get the fibonacci sequence to get the even number, to then find the total of the even numbers found. I have found issues on the way. I have found a way to get the divisible by 2 from numbers between 1 and 4 million. I have still not found a way to get the fibonacci sequence.
